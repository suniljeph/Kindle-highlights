Scientists have studied airplane cabin crews who frequently fly on long-haul routes and have little chance to recover. Two alarming results have emerged. First, parts of their brains— specifically those related to learning and memory—had physically shrunk, suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel. Second, their short-term memory was significantly impaired. ey were considerably more forgetful than individuals of similar age and background who did not frequently travel through time zones.

Caffeine works by successfully battling with adenosine for the privilege of latching on to adenosine welcome sites—or receptors—in the brain. Once caffeine occupies these receptors, however, it does not stimulate them like adenosine, making you sleepy. Rather, caffeine blocks and effectively inactivates the receptors, acting as a masking agent.

“When there is a stock -market boom, and everyone is scrambling for common stocks, take all your common stocks and sell them. Take the proceeds and buy conservative bonds. No doubt the stocks you sold will go higher. Pay no attention to this– just wait for the depression which will come sooner or later. When this depression – or panic– becomes a national catastrophe, sell out the bonds (perhaps at a loss) and buy back the stocks. No doubt the stocks will go lower still. Again, pay no attention. Wait for the next boom. Continue to repeat this operation as long as you live, and you’ll have the pleasure of dying rich”.

The other thing to keep in mind is to have a wider imagination. No matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today, everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one’s thinking about. Events, like money, compound. And the central feature of compounding is that it’s never intuitive how big something can grow from a small beginning.

“Writing Data Flywheel” is a mechanism for endless inspiration. The sooner you start receiving feedback on your writing, the faster you will grow as a writer. The more data you can gather, the more insight you’ll have into what people want; the more your writing will resonate; the more people you will reach, and so on.

Writing online, and the immediacy of the feedback, prompts a high amount of anxiety. It’s the same reason people are afraid to speak in front of a crowd—the feedback is immediate (you can see how people feel by the looks on their faces). But it’s this back-and-forth, this instant reveal that also makes the process so valuable. The faster you can gather feedback in the form of data, the faster you can make decisions to move yourself forward. Conversely, the more you delay this feedback, the longer it’s going to take you to figure out “what’s working” and what’s not.

your real estate investment doesn’t just give you tax-free cash flow. It actually reduces your taxes on your salary and/or business income, because while there is positive cash flow of $7,000, the depreciation deduction of about $27,000 gives you a tax deduction against your other income of $20,000 ($27,000 less $7,000 to offset real estate income). That $20,000 additional deduction against your other income is worth $6,000 of reduced taxes on your other income in a typical 30% ordinary income tax bracket.

So your real return from your real estate is $7,000 plus an additional $6,000 of tax refund on taxes you normally would have paid on your salary and business income for a total return of $13,000, or $5,000 more than your after-tax return from the stock investment.

the tax law requires each business deduction to meet three tests. First, the expense must have a business purpose, which means the primary reason for spending money was for your business. Take meals as an example. To be deductible, the purpose of a meal must be business. This means you need to have a conversation about business with your dining partner before, during, or after the meal.

Second, the expense must be ordinary. An expense is ordinary if it is “customary and usual.” This means that within your industry, the expense should be typical of what would be spent, both in the amount of the expense and how often a person in your position would have the expense.

Put your family to work. Make your business a family business. Then when you travel for business, your family’s travel is deductible. And you can shift income from your higher tax bracket to their lower tax bracket. This creates permanent tax savings.

Put Your Family to Work in Your Business and Investing One of the great tax benefits of existing on the B and the I side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant is the ability to legally shift income to your children. Children are taxpayers too, and they have their own tax brackets when it comes to earned income, which is income they work for. When they earn income through an outside job, they pay tax at their own rates.

Kids can also earn income from working in the family business or from investments. The nice thing about having your children work for you is that you get a tax deduction at your higher tax bracket for the payroll and they report the income at their lower tax bracket.

My long-time friend and client did this with his 9-year-old daughter. He put her to work doing the bookkeeping for his real estate investments. She is a very intelligent 9-year old and has no problem understanding the bookkeeping. Her mother, who is in charge of their real estate, supervises her. She gets a reasonable wage for her work as compared to other bookkeepers. In a year, she might earn $4,000. That $4,000 will be a deduction to her parents. She doesn’t earn any other income and the standard deduction plus her exemptions is more than $4,000. So, she doesn’t pay any tax. In my client’s 40 percent tax bracket, that $4,000 in pay to their daughter means a tax savings of $1,600. Now, for the best part. My client’s daughter is learning how to do bookkeeping and becoming part of their business. She is gaining a skill that will benefit her for her entire life, and she is beginning to understand real estate investing. No wonder Congress allows this type of planning.

When you buy an asset that produces income, you can deduct a portion of it each year you own it. If it’s a physical asset, such as real estate or equipment, the deduction is called depreciation. If it’s an intangible asset (one you can’t feel or touch, such as a customer list or computer software), the deduction is called amortization.

The trick is to properly document the values of all the items you depreciate in a cost segregation or chattel appraisal—even better, have a tax professional or engineer document them for you. Without it, the tax collector can make your tax savings from depreciation disappear. Protect your tax savings with good documentation.

Second, and more important, is how the law treats cost segregations. When you do a cost segregation on a building you have owned for several years, you must file a form 3115, “Change in Accounting Method.” There are two types of changes on this form. One is a change from one correct method of accounting to another correct method of accounting.

When you do a cost segregation, no matter how many years later, you get to catch up on all the depreciation you would have taken if you had done your cost segregation in the year you purchased the property. So, if you have owned the property for several years, you will have a lot of extra deductions in the year you do the cost segregation. Be sure you meet with your tax advisor and ask about cost segregations for all of your business and investment real estate.

Modify your investment strategy. Some real estate investments have “built in” tax savings that don’t require you to do anything extra to write off the losses against any other income you have. Oil and gas are examples of these investments, where as much as 100 percent of the investment can be written off in the first two years. Buckets of Money Think about your income as if you had to put it into one of five buckets. Earned Income The first bucket is your earned income. This bucket has some serious holes in it. Your income runs out of those holes in the form of high income taxes and high employment taxes. Even if you’re in a country where your employer pays the employment taxes, think about how much higher your income could be if your employer didn’t have to pay those taxes.
